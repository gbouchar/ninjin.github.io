# Contact #

The preferred way to contact me is always by e-mail, unless your mail requires
significant action on my part or I am exceedingly busy I will reply swiftly:

Contrary to popular opinion about other people in academia I do not mind
**you**, yes **you**, fellow student, researcher or human, dropping me a few
lines asking for verification. Heck, even criticism **is** welcome. If I can
in any way clarify or if you feel that you can correct (and thus help) me in
any way, taking the time to write me an e-mail is very much appreciated.
