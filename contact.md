        place."

The preferred way to contact me is always by e-mail, unless your mail requires
significant action on my part or I am exceedingly busy I will reply swiftly:

<!-- If we don't have any JavaScript we use a simple form that really only can
    be translated into a single address (well, web-wise pretty much all e-mail
    has an "at" and a "dot", in that order). -->
<code id="obfuscated">
    pontus stenetorp se
</code>
<!-- But if we do have JavaScript we de-obfuscate the e-mail for the user. -->
<script type="text/javascript">
// This should be difficult enough for most bots.
obfuscated.textContent = obfuscated.textContent
        .replace('s s', 's@s').replace('p s', 'p.s');
</script>

Contrary to a popular misconception about people in academia, most (and myself
in particular) do not mind **you**, yes **you**, fellow researcher, student,
and/or human, dropping a few lines asking for verification. Heck, even
criticism **is** usually welcome.

If I can in any way clarify or if you feel that you can correct (and thus
help) me in any way, taking the time to write me an e-mail is very much
appreciated.

In the case that you want to have a secure channel of communication, please
send your message as an e-mail attachment encrypted using [my public Pretty
Good Privacy (PGP) key][pgp_key]. Also, make sure that you attach your own
public key along with your message so that we can save a round-trip.
