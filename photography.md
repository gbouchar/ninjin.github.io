## Art ##

Photography is the only way I feel comfortable to express myself artistically.
Sure, I can write, somewhat, but drawing, dance, woodwork and the likes has
never been my strong points.
I am a happy amateur at best, a complete clutz at worst.
On this page I try to share the least bad of my work, I also admittedly have
an enormous back-log of pictures to develop digitally.

I try to stay as true as possible to the picture when developing, only tuning
global options rather then working with smaller aspects of the picture.
I don't think this makes the pictures more "real", but it is a workflow that I
like and it forces me to obsess about taking pictures rather than re-touch the
ones I already have.

If you like a picture and want to use it, they are CC-BY just like the rest of
the homepage.
If you like it so much that you want the raw image to post-process yourself
just send me an e-mail and I'll hand it to you.
I won't post images I take on any social network, I somehow feel that just
like George Carlin once said: "Not every ejaculation deserves a name", not
every picture you take deserves the attention of your friends.
