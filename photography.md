## On Art and Photography ##

Photography is possibly the only way I feel comfortable to express myself artistically.
Sure, I can write, somewhat, but drawing, dance, woodwork and the likes has
never been my strong points.
I am a happy amateur at best, a complete clutz at worst.
On this page I try to share the least bad of my work, I also admittedly have
an enormous backlog of pictures to develop digitally.

I try to stay as true as possible to the picture when developing and have a
rather simple workflow.
Crop, straighten, remove dust, tune global options such as blacks
and saturation, then export, done.
It is not that I think that this makes the pictures more "real",
but it offers me a workflow that
forces me to go out and take pictures rather than to re-touch the
ones I have already taken.

If you like a picture and want to use it, they are [CC-BY][ccby] just like the rest of
the homepage.
If you like it so much that you want a high-resolution version
or the raw image to post-process yourself,
just send me an e-mail and I will hand it to you.
