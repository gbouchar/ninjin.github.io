I have just performed some well-needed cleaning of the website and it is
beginning to look at least mildly respectable (especially when getting rid of
some stupidity due to my incompetence when it comes to web design)

Given that after coming back to Japan after a lengthy conference I think I can
justify taking it a little bit easier than usual and try to get those blogs
rolling. Expect to see some updates in the coming hours/days.
