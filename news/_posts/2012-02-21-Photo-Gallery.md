I have added [a photography page][photography] with a few photos in a gallery.
I am using [Galleria][galleria] which works rather nicely, but I am not really
happy with the JPG arctifacts it introduces when scaling.
I probably need to look into the documentation further when/if I have the
time.

[photography]: /photography.html
[galleria]: http://www.galleria.io/
