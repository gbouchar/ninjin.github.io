It has been a while, almost three years, since I last was blogging.
Where [I left off](http://svenskarnaidalen.blogspot.com/2009/04/avslut.html) I
had just left the California in favour of Japan.
What followed was pretty much two years of chaos followed by six months of hard
work serenity.
Taking me from my master student roots and now striving to becoming a decent
Ph.D student.

Oh, as always, I forgot to introduce myself.
Assuming that you skipped the index page I will give a brief description of
the entity before you.
My name is Pontus Stenetorp, I live (and work, mostly work) in Tokyo, Japan.
I have a vested interest in close to everything related to computers
(including the parts involving maths, thank you Viggo Kann and Stefan Nilsson
for bringing the joy of complexity theory to me) and in particular their
relationship to natural languages ("natural" languages is us computer
scientists silly little way of pointing out that we are talking about human
language as opposed to the ones your computer speaks in order to communicate
and render the contents of this homepage for example).

Expect this blog to be a bit technical, I am not expecting my family or
relatives to read/get the content here.
Instead I hope to unload some much needed opinions on life, computers and
hopefully I will become a better person by doing it (not sure how that will
work out, but you can't blame me for not trying).
