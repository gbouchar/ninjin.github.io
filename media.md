Sometimes I (rather undeservingly) receive some mass media attention.
Below are some links.
When the original article is in a non-English language I provide a Google
Translate link (it gives a rough approximation of the actual text, my name is
not "Stone Cottage" for example...).

## Dagens Nyheter 2011-03-11 ##

[Swedish news paper article][dn_svensk] ([Google Translate][dn_svensk_gt])
about me and my initial experiences after the disaster that struck Japan on
the very same day.
This was before Fukushima Daiichi had become an issue and before we fully
comprehended the horror of what had happened along the coast of Touhoku and
how many villages and their citizens that had been struck by the wave.
I can highly recommend reading the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK)
letters from Touhoku, it is heart shattering and a reminder of what truly
happened on that day, something which dwarfs the panic and one-sided
international reporting focusing on Fukishima Daiichi alone (I should write a
short essay on this media issue, here is [one by a friend with some minor
additions by me][no_panic]).

Strictly speaking, not mass media, but [an interview with me about my student
life at KTH][kth_interview] ([Google Translate][kth_interview_gt]), what I had
experienced and where I was going next.

## Svenska Dagbladet 2008-06-15 ##

[Swedish news paper article][svd_farska] ([Google Translate][svd_farska_gt])
about me and my team that participated (rather unsuccessfully, but we had tons
of fun with the technical details of our game rather than the game design) in
the Swedish Game Awards of 2008.
