if you prefer, but buy me a drink some time and I will tell you all about how
I ended up with possibly the longest name in Japan and what it does to your
average company customer database), I am a special project research associate
at the [National Institute of Informatics][nii] and a visiting researcher at
the [University of Tokyo][todai].
To the right is a portrait of me from the "Artfully Connected" exhibition with
an eye-painting by [Hikaru Cho][cho] on the theme "Let's see things through
someone else's eye".

I was raised in a [land of snow and beautiful summers][sweden] in a [small
town that most people have never heard of][lindesberg] (and for good reasons),
attended [Kungliga Tekniska högskolan][kth] (Royal Institute of Technology) in
Stockholm and received the degree of Master in Science and Engineering in
Computer Science in 2010.
I then joined the [Tsujii Laboratory][tsujii] at the [University of
Tokyo][todai] and was a member until the official closing of the lab in 2012
and then spent the remainder of my Ph.D. until my graduation in the spring of
2013 as a member of the [Aizawa Laboratory][aizawa], also at the [University
of Tokyo][todai].

The topic of my research is almost solely [Natural Language Processing][nlp]
(NLP), which is the task of processing text from sources such as newspapers,
blogs, etc. using computers.
But, I have recently also started to blend in a healthy dose of [Machine
Learning][ml], in particular [Deep Learning][deep], since I find that it
allows me to generalise beyond a single task and to talk about semantics in a
meaningful way.

About language, [Carl Sagan][sagan] once said that writing allows humans to
transfer knowledge between individuals across time and space, a feat which is
truly incredible.
We humans describe our experiences in words, a form computers still have
difficulties to grasp due to its frequently ambiguous and unstructured
nature, I thus see my line of research as an attempt to tap into this vast
source of knowledge, something that I find both challenging and rewarding.

As with most researchers I have several topics of interests in my field such
as Information Extraction (IE), computational lexical semantics and
the extrinsic/intrinsic evaluation of NLP systems.
I am also active in the sub-field of Biomedical Natural Language Processing
(BioNLP) which I find to be an interesting application of NLP techniques.
On the side I dabble in and read a wide array of topics such as evolutionary
linguistics, computer security.
If you share any of my interests you may want to have a glance at my hopefully
growing [list of publications][publications].

During what spare time I have left after, I enjoy producing code for fun
("hacking"), biking, traveling and photography.
My [Erdős number][erdos] is 5 (Me -> J. J. Li -> T. Kowalski -> P. Jipsen
-> Z. Tuza -> P. Erdős).
Actually, it is probably lower by now, but I have been unable to find a
reasonably easy way to calculate it automatically since I have not published a
pure mathematics paper.
