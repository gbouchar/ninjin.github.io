My name is Pontus Stenetorp, I am a second year Ph.D. student at the [Aizawa
Laboratory][aizawa] at [The University of Tokyo][todai] in Tokyo, Japan. To
the right is a not-so-pleasing picture of me and my dog (she looks better than
me on this occasion).

My research interests is primarily in the domain of Biomedical Natural
Language Processing (BioNLP), but I also have a great deal of interest in
evolutionary linguistics, in particular in relation to changes in vocabulary.
If you are interested you can have a glance at my hopefully growing [list of
publications][publications].

I was raised in [a land of snow and beautiful summers][sweden] in a [small
town that most people have never heard of][lindesberg] (and for good reasons),
attended [Kungliga Tekniska högskolan][kth] (The Royal Institute of
Technology) in Stockholm and received the degree of Master in Science and
Engineering in Computer Science.

During what spare time I have left, I enjoy tinkering with computers, producing
code for fun, [hacking on an operating system][freebsd], biking, traveling and
photography. My [Erdős number][erdos] is 5 (Me -> J. J. Li -> T. Kowalski ->
P. Jipsen -> Z. Tuza -> P. Erdős).
