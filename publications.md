This page contains hopefully growing list of publications.
Due to copyright reasons I am sometimes not allowed to host my publications on
this site, I refer to these as external Portable Document Format (PDF) files
(![External PDF][external_pdf_icon]).
However, in most cases I provide a link to the authorative external publisher
and to a local copy (![Local PDF][local_pdf_icon]) that is served by this
website.
If the publication was presented as a presentation, the slides
(![Slides][slides_icon]) are hosted on this site.
For cases where it was presented as a poster (![Poster][poster_icon]) or both
as a presentation and a poster, a copy of the poster is linked as well.
In regards to BibTeX, I personally check the BibTeX files on
this page so that they are accurate, so please use them over the
Google Scholar BibTeX since the Google ones frequently contain errors.
If you have any questions or find errors in my publications, feel free to
[contact me][contact_page] about it.

## International ##

Papers published at international scientific venues, international is used in
the sense that the venue does not limit its audience to anything less than the
global scientific community.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise these papers have undergone peer-review.

## Domestic ##

Domestic conferences, at least in the case of Japan, are seldom peer-reviewed
and are thus treated differently than the above publications.
Since non-peer-reviewed papers doesn't count as a prior publication material
from these papers may make it into papers submitted to international venues as
a partial contribution if the domestic organisers allow for this.

## Theses ##

Theses are not peer-reviewed or presented to a wider audience.
However, they can be of interest to a researcher since they provide a summary
of current methods and can thus be an entry point to a scientific field.
Preferably findings should be published in a peer-reviewed venue, but that is
not always the case.

Do note that you will not find a bachelor thesis below, the now out-dated
Swedish system for attaining a Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.)
involved enrolling a student for four-and-a-half or five years after
completing upper secondary school (high school for our American readers, it
should also be noted that Swedish higher education still lacks a first year of
introductory courses followed by deciding your major, Swedish students have
instead spent an additional year in upper secondary school and graduate
at an age of 19).

### 2010 ###

* *Pontus Stenetorp*. **Automated Extraction of Swedish Neologisms using a
    Temporally Annotated Corpus**. Master of Science in Engineering
    (M.Sc.Eng.) Thesis, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), March 2010.
